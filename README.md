## Developer Guide

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

### Install rlm in Development mode

``` sh
# make sure rlm package is installed in development mode
$ pip install -e .

# make changes under nbs/ directory
# ...

# compile to have changes apply to rlm
$ nbdev_prepare
```

## Usage

### Installation

```

or from [conda](https://anaconda.org/numb3r33/rlm)

``` sh
$ conda install -c numb3r33 rlm
```

or from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/rlm/)

```

### Documentation

Documentation can be found hosted on this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/numb3r33/rlm)’s
[pages](https://numb3r33.github.io/rlm/). Additionally you can find
package manager specific guidelines on
[conda](https://anaconda.org/numb3r33/rlm) and
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/rlm/) respectively.

## Quick Start

Here’s a simple example of using RLM to answer questions over long
documents:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=“your-key-here”

### Basic Usage

    from rlm.tools import prep_shell, make_run_repl 
    from rlm.core import advanced_toolloop 
    from rlm.prompts import REPL_SYSTEM_PROMPT

### Your long document/context

    with open("document.txt") as f: 
        context = f.read()

### Setup RLM

    sh = prep_shell(context, model="openai/openai/gpt-oss-120b", base_url="https://your-litellm-gateway.com")
    run_repl = make_run_repl(sh)

### Ask a question

query = “What are the main themes discussed in this document?”

### Run RLM with verbose output

    responses = advanced_toolloop( query, sp=REPL_SYSTEM_PROMPT, tools=[run_repl], sh=sh, model="openai/openai/gpt-oss-120b", base_url="https://your-litellm-gateway.com", max_steps=50, verbose=True)

### Get the answer

    for item in responses:
        if isinstance(item, dict) and item.get("type") == "final":
            print(f"Answer: {item['answer']}")

### Vanialla approach ( may fail with very long context )

    try:
        vanilla_result = benchmark_vanilla(context, query, model="gpt-4", base_url="...")
        print(f"Vanilla: {vanilla_result['time']:.2f}s, {vanilla_result['tokens']} tokens")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Vanilla failed: {e}")

### RLM approach

    rlm_result = benchmark_rlm(context, query, model="gpt-4", base_url="...", verbose=True)
    print(f"RLM: {rlm_result['time']:.2f}s, {rlm_result['tokens']} tokens")
    print(f"Answer: {rlm_result['answer']}")

## FAQ

### When should I use RLM vs vanilla LLM?

**Use RLM when:** - Context exceeds model’s window (100k+ tokens) - You
experience “context rot” (model gets worse with long conversations) -
Task requires reasoning across many documents - You want adaptive,
test-time chunking strategies

**Use vanilla when:** - Context is short (\< 10k tokens) - Simple fact
retrieval - Speed is critical and context fits easily

### What’s the difference between `max_steps` and recursion depth?

- **`max_steps`**: How many REPL iterations the root LM gets
  (horizontal - loop count)
- **Recursion depth**: How deep calls can nest (vertical - call stack
  depth)

RLM enforces depth=1 by design: root LM can call `llm_query()`, but
those calls can’t spawn further recursion.

### Why doesn’t the model always use FINAL()?

Some models don’t consistently follow the FINAL() instruction. RLM
includes a fallback that captures the last assistant message if FINAL()
isn’t detected.

### How does RLM compare to RAG?

**RLM advantages:** - No pre-indexing needed - Adaptive search
strategies (model decides how to explore) - Better for complex
multi-step reasoning

**RAG advantages:** - Faster for simple lookups - Works well with
persistent knowledge bases - Lower cost per query for repeated queries

### Can I customize the system prompt?

Yes! Import and modify `REPL_SYSTEM_PROMPT` or create your own:

    from rlm.prompts import REPL_SYSTEM_PROMPT

    custom_prompt = REPL_SYSTEM_PROMPT + "\nAdditional instructions here..."

## Future Directions

Based on the [Recursive Language Models
paper](https://alexzhang13.github.io/blog/2025/rlm/), here are planned
enhancements:

### Short-term

- **Token/cost tracking**: Detailed metrics for each step
- **Multiple benchmark tasks**: Expand beyond document Q&A
- **Error recovery improvements**: Better handling of API failures and
  malformed tool calls
- **Configurable FINAL detection**: Custom patterns beyond FINAL() and
  FINAL_VAR()

### Medium-term

- **Training for recursion**: Fine-tune models explicitly for RLM
  patterns (like o1 for reasoning)
- **Deeper recursion**: Support depth \> 1 for more complex tasks
- **Multi-modal context**: Support for images, tables, structured data
- **Streaming responses**: Real-time answer updates as RLM progresses

### Long-term

- **RL-based optimization**: Learn optimal chunking and recursion
  strategies
- **Hybrid RAG+RLM**: Combine pre-indexed retrieval with adaptive
  exploration
- **Benchmark suite**: Comprehensive evaluation across domains
